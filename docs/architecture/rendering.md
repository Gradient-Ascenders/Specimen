# Rendering and assets

## Renderer boundary

`RenderLayer` owns the renderer, canvas, root scene, camera rig, resize policy,
colour-space configuration, and application frame render. Level scenes own
their lights, environment effects, materials, meshes, and render resources.
Gameplay collision always uses authored primitives and registries; deforming
visual meshes, colours, names, and shader output are never gameplay authority.

The renderer uses a relative Vite base so built assets work at a domain root or
nested static-host path. Runtime asset references must remain Vite-managed or
relative and must match Linux filename casing.

## Materials, lighting, and shadows

Shared presentation helpers may reuse geometry, materials, and procedural
textures, but ownership must be explicit. The creator disposes a resource once;
borrowers must not dispose it. A level unload must return renderer geometry and
texture counts to their stable warm values.

Shadow maps are reserved for lights and geometry that materially improve
navigation, hazard readability, or character grounding. Static room shadows
should be prepared and cached where supported. Dynamic character and device
casters remain bounded. New lights require a documented role and an evaluation
of map size, render passes, and first-entry cost.

Later-level presentation can be prepared asynchronously before handoff. A
preparation task must be cancellable, must not attach its temporary scene to the
live game, and must dispose temporary render targets, shadow maps, geometries,
and materials on completion or cancellation. Runtime rendering must remain
correct when preparation is skipped or fails.

## Character and content assets

Production Bob is loaded from `assets/characters/bob/bob-authored.glb`; its
kinematic sphere remains the gameplay body. Runtime deformation may change
scale, morph targets, facing, eyes, and materials, but must preserve the
collider/visual separation and restore neutral state on reset.

Keep only production assets and the source/generator inputs required to
reproduce them. Candidate renders, approval screenshots, rejected models, and
capture output belong in external review artifacts. A generated production
asset should have a deterministic validation contract when source provenance or
mesh structure is important.

## Verification

For rendering changes, verify the ordinary journey and affected level under a
production build. Check narrow and wide viewports, restart/unload cycles,
console and network output, WebGL errors, shader-program counts, and stable warm
geometry/texture counts. CPU/SwiftShader browser checks are correctness smoke
tests, not hardware performance measurements.
